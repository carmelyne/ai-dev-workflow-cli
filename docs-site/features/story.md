# AI-Enhanced Story Creation

The AI Dev Workflow CLI provides sophisticated story creation capabilities that leverage AI to help break down and analyze development tasks.

## Usage

```bash
ai-dev story create "Feature Name" --description "Feature description"
```

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis
The AI analyzes your story from multiple perspectives:
- Business Value Assessment
- Technical Impact Analysis
- Risk Assessment
- Timeline Estimation
- Task Breakdown
- Test Scenario Generation

### 2. Smart Templates
Stories are created using AI-enhanced templates that include:
- Acceptance Criteria
- Technical Dependencies
- Implementation Strategy
- Documentation Requirements
- Progress Tracking

### 3. Project Context Awareness
The AI takes into account:
- Existing codebase structure
- Related stories and features
- Project patterns and conventions

## Example

```bash
# Create a new story
ai-dev story create "User Authentication" --description "Implement OAuth2 based authentication system"

# View generated story
ai-dev story show "user-authentication"

# Update story status
ai-dev story update "user-authentication" --status "In Progress"
```

## Story Structure

Each story includes:

```markdown
# User Story: [Title]

## Description
[User provided description]

## Business Value
[AI-analyzed business impact]

## Acceptance Criteria
[AI-generated criteria]

## Technical Analysis
- Architecture Impact
- Dependencies
- Implementation Approach

## Tasks Breakdown
[AI-generated tasks with complexity]

## Risk Assessment
[AI-identified risks and mitigations]

## Testing Strategy
[AI-generated test scenarios]

## Documentation Requirements
[AI-identified documentation needs]

## Progress Tracking
[Status and timeline tracking]
```

## Configuration

Stories are stored in `.ai/stories/` and can be configured in `.ai/config.yaml`:

```yaml
templates:
  story:
    path: ".ai/templates/story.md"
    variables:
      - "title"
      - "description"
      - "status"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Provide Clear Descriptions**
   - The more detailed your description, the better the AI analysis
   - Include context and objectives

2. **Review AI Analysis**
   - AI suggestions are starting points
   - Review and refine the generated content

3. **Keep Stories Updated**
   - Regular status updates help track progress
   - Update completion status of tasks and criteria

4. **Link Related Stories**
   - Use cross-references when stories are related
   - Helps maintain context and dependencies
