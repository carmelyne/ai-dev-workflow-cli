- Commit the changes once every looks good

2. Implement #1 from TODO.md
- Install the necessary packages and configure them for optimal testing & ease of use
- Implement the tests and code coverage running each to ensure they work
- Build the project again to ensure everything is cool
- Commit the changes 

3. Create a pull request for the changes with a complete description of what you've done and asking if there are modifications that would improve the PR
