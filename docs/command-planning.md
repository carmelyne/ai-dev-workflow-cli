## Commands to Define
1. Context Management

   - [ ] `ai forget <item>` - Remove items from context
   - [ ] `ai tag <item> <tag>` - Tag items for organization

## Next Steps
1. Define command specifications:
   - Arguments and options
   - Input/output formats
   - Error handling
   - Examples

2. Group commands by:
   - Core vs. Extended functionality
   - Individual vs. Team usage
   - Context vs. Code operations

3. Consider:
   - Command aliases for common operations
   - Batch operations
   - Integration with existing tools
   - Configuration options

## Notes
- Keep command naming consistent
- Ensure clear, single-responsibility for each command
- Document common workflows
- Consider progressive disclosure of complexity
