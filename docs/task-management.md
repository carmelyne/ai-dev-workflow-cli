# Task Management in AI Development Workflow

## Overview
Task management is a core feature that ties together context, workflow, and team collaboration. It helps developers maintain focus, track progress, and manage context switches effectively.

## Key Features

### 1. Task Context Isolation
- Each task has its own context bubble
- Prevents context pollution between tasks
- Allows parallel work on multiple features

### 2. Context Preservation
- Auto-save context when switching tasks
- Restore context when resuming tasks
- Link related contexts between tasks

### 3. Task Hierarchy
- Parent-child task relationships
- Task dependencies tracking
- Progress rollup to parent tasks

### 4. Integration Points
- Version Control
  * Branch management
  * Commit grouping
  * PR generation
- Issue Tracking
  * Two-way sync with issue trackers
  * Status updates
  * Time tracking
- Team Collaboration
  * Shared context
  * Task handoffs
  * Progress visibility

## Task Lifecycle

1. Creation
   ```bash
   ai task new
   # Interactive prompts for:
   # - Task description
   # - Dependencies
   # - Priority
   # - Expected outcome
   ```

2. Active Development
   ```bash
   ai task start <id>    # Sets up development environment
   ai task context       # Shows/edits current context
   ai task pause <id>    # Saves state and switches out
   ```

3. Completion
   ```bash
   ai task done <id>     # Marks complete, archives context
   ai task export        # Generates PR/ticket updates
   ```

## Context Management

### Per-Task Context
- Development environment state
- Relevant code sections
- Decision history
- Notes and TODOs
- References and resources

### Context Switching
- Automatic state preservation
- Environment restoration
- IDE integration
- Terminal session management

### Context Sharing
- Team visibility into task state
- Knowledge transfer
- Progress tracking
- Blockers and dependencies

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Storage
- Local task database
- Context storage format
- Sync mechanism

### 2. Performance
- Fast context switching
- Efficient storage
- Quick search and retrieval

### 3. Integration
- Git hooks
- IDE plugins
- CI/CD pipeline

### 4. User Experience
- Simple command interface
- Progressive complexity
- Clear feedback
- Intuitive defaults

## Future Enhancements

1. Smart Task Management
   - AI-powered task prioritization
   - Automatic dependency detection
   - Context relevance scoring

2. Team Features
   - Task handoff workflow
   - Shared context management
   - Progress analytics

3. Advanced Integration
   - Custom workflow automation
   - External tool integration
   - Analytics and reporting

## Success Metrics
