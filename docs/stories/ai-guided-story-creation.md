Feature: AI-Guided Story Creation

  As a developer
  I want to collaborate with an AI assistant to define and structure my feature requirements
  So that I can efficiently translate my ideas into well-defined, actionable development tasks

  Scenario: Developer creates a feature with AI guidance
    Given I am a developer working on a new feature
    And I have access to the AI development workflow CLI
    When I engage in a conversation with the AI about my feature idea
    Then the AI helps me structure my thoughts into a formal user story
    And provides a clear set of requirements and acceptance criteria
    And generates the necessary documentation structure

  Acceptance Criteria:
    - [ ] AI engages in an interactive dialogue to understand feature requirements
    - [ ] Automatically formats user input into proper Gherkin syntax
    - [ ] Creates structured documentation with technical specifications
    - [ ] Generates clear, measurable acceptance criteria
    - [ ] Provides a summary of the conversation and decisions made
    - [ ] Creates all necessary documentation files following the project's structure
