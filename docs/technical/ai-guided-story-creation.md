# AI-Guided Story Creation

## Overview
This feature enhances the AI development workflow by providing an interactive, AI-driven approach to creating user stories and feature specifications. It transforms casual developer conversations into structured, actionable development plans.

## Technical Design

### Components

1. **Story Creation Dialog**
   - Interactive CLI prompts for feature discussion
   - Natural language processing to extract key story elements
   - Conversion of dialogue into Gherkin syntax

2. **Documentation Generator**
   - Automatic creation of required documentation files
   - Template-based content generation
   - File structure management

### Implementation Details

#### CLI Commands
```bash
ai-dev story create              # Start interactive story creation
ai-dev story convert <input>     # Convert existing description to story format
ai-dev story export <format>     # Export story in different formats
```

#### Key Classes/Modules
- `StoryCreationDialog`: Manages the interactive conversation
- `GherkinFormatter`: Converts natural language to Gherkin syntax
- `DocumentationGenerator`: Handles file creation and structure

### Data Flow
1. User initiates story creation dialogue
2. AI processes input and extracts key elements
3. Story structure is generated and validated
4. Documentation files are created and populated
5. Summary is presented for user review

## Dependencies
- Natural language processing capabilities
- Template engine for documentation
- File system operations
- Git integration

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive data storage
- Local file system operations only
- Git credentials handled by system

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for the complete workflow
3. User acceptance testing with real dialogue scenarios
